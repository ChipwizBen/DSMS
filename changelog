1.3.0:  - Added full Audit Log 'audit-log.cgi'. Nearly all files have been modified to integrate with the 
          new audit system.
        - Added a password salting system to increase password security (against rainbow attacks) beyond 
          the current SHA-512 hashing process to SHA-512 + 64 character salt.
        - Some general interface changes to make things a bit tidier (particularly tables).
        - Added MD5 and SHA1 checksum to sudoers file.
        - Adjusted 'Sudoers Not Found' to include links to referenced pages.
        - Added helpful descriptions to 'common.pl' components.
        - Renamed 'user-management.cgi' to 'account-management.cgi' to avoid confusing system users with 
          sudo users. Updated 'header.cgi' to reflect name change.
        - Enforced the reservation of the 'System' user name.
        - Updated account requirements description to include notice of reserved 'System' user name.
        - Added better error handling of duplicate user name and email rejections for new and edited users.
        - Fixed a bug where linked hosts, users and commands were not correctly dropped from the link 
          table if they were deleted but still belonged to a group or rule.
        - Fixed a bug where linked groups were not correctly dropped from the rule to group link table.
        - Fixed a bug in 'account-management.cgi' where an Admin that modified their own rights had their 
          access stripped for the current session only and could not reach any administrative page without 
          first logging out and back in.
        - Added syntax highlighting for potentially dangerous commands (like *).
----------------
1.2.2:  - System now uses 'time' epoch instead of 'localtime' string for calculating expiry as the 'localtime'
          output string varied and was unreliable for calculations. 'localtime' remains in use for variables
          where a string time is specified (such as "$Date = strftime "%Y-%m-%d", localtime;").
1.2.1:  - Reduced Date::Parse module requirement from Date::Parse to Date::Parse qw(str2time).
1.2.0:  - Added item and rule expiry system. Added Date::Parse to requirement list (see README).
----------------
1.1.1:  - Trimmed legacy files.
1.1.0:  - Moved environmental variables from 'sudoers-build.pl' to dedicated plain text 
          'environmental-variables' file so users don't need to edit the sudoers-build.pl script.
----------------
1.0.2:  - Renamed from  Sudoers Build System to  Sudoers Management System to better describe
          the system's purpose.
        - Modified 'login.cgi', 'lockout.cgi', 'header.cgi' to pull name from new subroutine in 'common.pl' 
          so the name can be easily edited to fit more easily into different customer environments.
        - Added a short name (DSMS) subroutine to 'common.pl'.
1.0.2:  - Added version numbering system to this file (hello!) and to 'common.pl'.
        - Modified index.cgi to display version number.
1.0.1:  - Fixed SQL bug in 'sudoers-commands.cgi' which prevented commands from being deleted.
1.0.0:  - Initial release.
