1.2.2 -	System now uses 'time' epoch instead of 'localtime' string for calculating expiry as the localtime
		output string varied and was unreliable for calculations. 'localtime' remains in use for variables
		where a string time is specified (such as "$Date = strftime "%Y-%m-%d", localtime;").
1.2.1 -	Reduced Date::Parse module requirement from Date::Parse to Date::Parse qw(str2time).
1.2.0 -	Added item and rule expiry system. Added Date::Parse to requirement list (see README).
1.1.1 -	Trimmed legacy files.
1.1.0 -	Moved environmental variables from sudoers-build.pl to dedicated plain text environmental-variables
		file so users don't need to edit the sudoers-build.pl script.
1.0.2 -	Renamed from  Sudoers Build System to  Sudoers Management System to better describe
		the system's purpose. Modified login.cgi, lockout.cgi, header.cgi to pull name from new sub routine
		in common.pl so the name can be easily edited to fit more easily into different customer
		environments. Also added a short name (DSMS) sub routine to common.pl.
1.0.2 -	Added version numbering system (hello reader!) to common.pl and modified index.cgi to display version
		number.
1.0.1 -	Fixed SQL bug in sudoers-commands.cgi which prevented commands from being deleted.
1.0.0 -	Inital release.
